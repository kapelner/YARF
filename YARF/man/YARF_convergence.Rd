\title{Plot YARF convergence}
\usage{
YARF_convergence(yarf_mod, time_delay_in_seconds = 5, trail_pts = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{yarf_mod}{The yarf model object}

\item{time_delay_in_seconds}{Frequency of messages in seconds. Default is \code{5} seconds. Minimum is 0.1. 
\code{NULL} indicates it is shown once and then it completes.}

\item{trail_pts}{If non-null, it will plot a secondary window with only the trees in the last \code{trail_trees}
number of progress updates defined by \code{time_delay_in_seconds} 
versus error which allows assessing the convergence more closely.
Default is \code{50}.}
}
\description{
Prints out a messages reflecting the progress of the YARF model construction until completion.
}
\details{
If \code{time_delay_in_seconds} is not NULL, running this function once will slow down your model construction since it will forever
be calculating OOB statistics after each tree (until completion or until the user stops the function).
